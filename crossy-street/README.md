# Crossy Road Clone Framework

This is a simple Crossy Road-like game framework built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game uses the Canvas API for rendering.

## Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML file.
- `style.css`: Contains the canvas styling.
- `game.js`: Core game logic, easy to extend.
- `assets/`: Place for all game assets (images, sounds, etc.).

## How to Extend
- **Add Obstacles:** Modify the `gameState.obstacles` array and implement obstacle drawing.
- **Add Levels:** Increase speed over time or add new challenges.
- **Change Player Sprite:** Replace the green rectangle in `drawPlayer` with an image.

Enjoy building!
